# Agile Software Development in Practice

This projects contains the source code examples accompanying my "Agile Software Development in Practice"
lectures available on Slideshare: http://www.slideshare.net/BjrnKimminich/agile-software-development-in-practice

## Installation

1. Checkout project and import into IDE of your choice
2. Declare the ```src``` and ```test``` folder as source folders of the IDE project
3. Add all libraries in ```/examples/lib``` and its subfolders to the IDE project's classpath
4. Done!

## How is this project organized?

* ```de.kimminich.agile```
** ```.examples``` contains all source code examples from the presentation slides (packaged by lectures)
** ```.exercises``` contains source code required for doing the demos or exercises (packaged by lectures)
** ```.samplesolutions``` contains sample solutions for the exercises. The sample solutions are in no way considered perfect, nor are they the only valid solution for an exercise (packaged by lectures)

Source code and test code are put separated into the ```src``` and ```test``` folders. Both have the same package structure described above.
